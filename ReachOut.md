## Reaching Out

The purpose of this document is to give simple, concise talking points on communicating the effectiveness of a good "Get Involved" page.

### Front and Center
People naturally want to help. Making your get-involved page easy to find shows that a project is invested in its community and is welcome to contributions. Using community standard wording such as 'Get Involved', 'Participation' and 'Contribution' on your Home Page makes it easy for the reader to identify.  

### Offer to help!
Project developers are often juggling their project with other obligations such as work or family. Offering to help design a get-involved page could be one of the best ways you can help out!

### More than a Donate button
Emphasize that there are multiple ways volunteers can help with any project, not just contributing financially.  Translation, support and raising awareness are all effective ways to drum up support for a FOSS project. Link them to the [How you can help guide](https://github.com/killyourfm/contribute-foss#identifying-how-you-can-help) written by Jason Evangelho for tips on effectively engaging with a community.  

### Simple, Concise Design
Direct them to effective get-involved pages, such as the one at [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/get-involved/) for ideas on simple, concise layouts. Having an easy to find, easy to navigate get-involved page encourages support from the community.
